A Streamlit web app to check for exam schedule clashes by day and time for UIU courses.
  ðŸš€ **[Live Demo](https://uiu-exam-clash-checker.streamlit.app/)**

## Features

- **Check Clash By Day:** Detects if selected courses have exams scheduled on the same day.
- **Check Clash By Time:** Detects if selected courses have exams scheduled at the same time slot on the same day.

## How It Works

- The app loads course codes, exam days, and time slots from `cleanedRoutine.csv`.
- Users select courses from a searchable list.
- The app checks for scheduling conflicts and displays results.

## File Structure

- `script.py` â€” Clash detection functions.
- `cleanedRoutine.csv` â€” Exam schedule data (course codes, days, times).
- `uiu_courses.csv` â€” Course code and title mapping.

2. **Run the app:**
